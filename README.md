# Windows Activation Key Stealer | keystealer

The purpose of it is to obtain ("steal") the Windows activation key (I created the script using Windows 11, and I guarantee that it will work on Windows 10, but I can't say whether it would work for other versions as well).

* The activation key is in the BIOS, especially in newer versions of Windows, but I believe it's not the same for previous versions.
* If you're using linux, use the shell script.
